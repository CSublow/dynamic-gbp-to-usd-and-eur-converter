# Dynamic Currency Converter

This project utilises money.js and the API available from https://openexchangerates.org/ in order to convert a user-inputted amount in GBP to USD and EUR.

NOTE: This is an old project of mine, with 50% of it developed prior to me using version control, so there is a limited git history.
