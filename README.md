# Dynamic Currency Converter

This project utilises money.js and the API available from https://openexchangerates.org/ in order to take a currency value from a HTML page and convert it into a different currency using up-to-date exchange rates.

NOTE: This project is an old one of mine and was developed prior to me using version control, so there is a very limited git history.
